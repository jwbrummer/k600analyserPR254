In the calibrated ADC spectra you will see that some channels are bare. The reason is that the function TSpectrum did not find 5 or 6 peaks (which are the cases that the code in Calibration.cpp looks for) which means that those channels on the detectors either saw too many peaks or fewer peaks than they were supposed to. This is a possible indication of a channel on a detector going awry or dying.
