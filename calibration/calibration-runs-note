Run 63 seems to be the best calibration file so far.
Run 64 (only asymmetric run) has 0 gain/0 offset channels because some of the channels
didn't see 5 or 6 alpha peaks, which are the only two scenarious that the alpha
calibration code caters for.
Run 2087 has too few stats. For it to work it would have to be chained.
