If the analyser complains that it cant find or access the correct folder to write midas.log to because the path is 
unavailable, the path might be set to someone else's PC or to a folder that doesn't exist anymore.

Simply do:
odbedit
cd Logger

And set "Data dir" to the directory that contains the analyser folder.
