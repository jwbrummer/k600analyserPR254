What to do when pulling the analyser onto another PC to get it running:

Clone analyser and pull
The path to config.cfg in Parameters.c
Where the output.root file should be created
The path to the TDC offsets in config.cfg
The path to the ADC calibration file in config.cfg
Load the ODB
Make ODB
Edit experim.h
make analyser
Paths in the sorter you're going to use.
Paths in the triton-tree generator file.

That's all I can think of for now.
